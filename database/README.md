The complete database is made up of three main folders containing:
* raw data recorded with an accelerometer and a gyroscope,
* artificially stretched data to a fixed defined size on a raw basis,
* selected signal features determined on the basis of raw data.

Then, depending on the selected configuration subsets were created allowing for further tests.

Each smaller subset contains six folders representing the six families of selected exercises.

In each family folder, there are one hundred files containing information measured with the device or transformed with algorithms during one repetition.
